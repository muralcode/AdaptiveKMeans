# Custom Unsupervided AdaptiveKMeans Machine Learning Library

## Overview

AdaptiveKMeans is an advanced clustering library that offers enhanced features tailored for complex data clustering tasks. It incorporates sophisticated techniques such as Mahalanobis distance, feature scaling, and ensemble clustering to provide robust and efficient clustering solutions.

## Key Features and Enhancements

### Mahalanobis Distance

AdaptiveKMeans integrates Mahalanobis distance, a measure that considers the correlation structure of data, making it suitable for handling non-spherical clusters. This distance metric is particularly effective in scenarios where clusters exhibit varying shapes and sizes.

### Feature Scaling Techniques

The library employs feature scaling techniques to normalize data attributes, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process. This preprocessing step enhances clustering performance by reducing the impact of feature magnitudes on distance calculations.

### Ensemble Clustering

AdaptiveKMeans utilizes ensemble clustering methodologies to aggregate multiple clustering results, thereby improving the robustness and stability of clustering outcomes. Ensemble techniques mitigate the sensitivity to initialization conditions and enhance the reliability of cluster assignments.

### Installation

To install AdaptiveKMeans and leverage its advanced clustering capabilities, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install adaptive-kmeans
```
Ensure that all dependencies are met before proceeding with installation.
Usage

### Basic Usage

Integrate AdaptiveKMeans into your Python projects for efficient clustering operations:

```
from adaptive_kmeans import AdaptiveKMeans

# Example: Initialize and fit AdaptiveKMeans
model = AdaptiveKMeans(k=3)
model.fit(X)
clusters = model.predict(X)
```
### Advanced Usage

Explore advanced configurations and parameters to optimize AdaptiveKMeans for specific use cases:

Adjust distance metrics, scaling techniques, or ensemble strategies.
Fine-tune parameters to enhance clustering performance and accuracy.
